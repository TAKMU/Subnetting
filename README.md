# Subnetting
This program was made by Allan Ken Miyazono Ushijima

This program is still a work in progress (I started the program on october 29). I made this program to try and practice both C++ and subnetting. 

There are several things that I didn't know before that are applied in this program:

-Returning arrays from fuctions, using pointers (to transform a decimal number to a binary)

-Using pointers as dinamic allocation of arrays

-Sorting pointers

I will be trying to finish this program in the upcoming days, however I wanted to show this program to showcase my actual abilities for my resume (couldn't make it in time). 
After I finish this program, I will try and do the same program in Python.
